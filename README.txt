I wanted to express my sincere thanks for the recent assignment. It provided me with valuable new experiences and was a lot of fun. I'm truly grateful for the opportunity.

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a dashboard using React for the frontend, Django for the backend, and MySQL for the database. Here are the steps to start the project:

1. Download all three project files.

2. Import the SQL file into your MySQL database to populate it with necessary data.

3. Begin by opening the Django project and setting up a virtual environment by running:
   "myenv/scripts/activate".

4. Go to the "admindashboard" folder and start the Django development server with the command:
   "python manage.py runserver". Congratulations, your API is now deployed.

5. Next, open the React project in the command prompt and start it by running:
   "npm start". Your dashboard panel is now ready to view.

Please note that only port 3000 has access to the API.

Thank you once again for this opportunity.

Best regards,
Manish Ray
